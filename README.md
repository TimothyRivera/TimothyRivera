I’m Timothy Rivera, a web developer in Denver. 
While my background is primarily web development, I recently started learning about mobile app development, and feel like I can combine those two things to get the most of my skills and time. 
My areas of expertise right now are Android development and iOS development, but I also have a lot of experience working with other languages and frameworks. 
I’m working on a lot of open-source projects right now and enjoy working on new things. 
I’m still learning, and it’s been great to help spread that knowledge to other developers in this way. 
Funding is used to keep Open Source developers working on projects we enjoy, but don’t have the resources to continue to run, as well as keep Open Source code up-to-date. 
Open Source projects are developed over the long term, typically over periods of months or years. We’re always on the lookout for volunteers to help with maintenance and additional development work. 
You can become a paid member and participate in many different ways, even though teaching, reviewing code, contributing code, and finding bugs. Many of our paid members work in several of these roles at the same time!
Open Source projects are often built on top of older, commercial code. We work to support those legacy pieces of code to ensure that the new software we create does not inadvertently break those older, already-established open-source projects. 
If you’re working on an Open Source project with a commercial dependency that needs some help or is about to be published, we can be of tremendous help with helping make that transition work.
I have worked with companies like <a href="https://sunpharma.com/">Sun Pharma</a>, <a href="https://ajantaproducts.com/
